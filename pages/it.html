					<h2>This website</h2>
					<p>Indeed, this website is, in itself, a computer project. It shows that I have a good grasp of HTML and CSS. Clearly, the design leaves much to be desired, and as you will see in my other projects, it's not my strong suit. I'm more someone who enjoys tackling logical problems than dealing with colors. Nevertheless, I can reproduce a design created by a graphic designer. This website completely passes the validator tests.</p>

					<h2>Fnaf on scratch</h2>
					<p>We all start somewhere. Personally, I discovered coding with Scratch. I decided to try creating games with it, which is its main purpose. I created several small games with it, but they were not very significant. However, one that I consider important and that challenged me a bit is a replica of the game "Five Nights at Freddy's" that I made. I really enjoyed imagining how Scott Cawthon (the creator of FNAF) coded his mechanics, and I had to try to adapt them to the block-based language of Scratch.</p>

					<p>The game includes a menu that allows you to start the game and change settings. Inside, you can enable or disable the enemies you want. At the beginning of the game, there's a passable cinematic. After that, you can view the cameras from your tablet, the animatronics are visible on the screen, and they change rooms. When they are in front of your office, you must lock the doors on your tablet to avoid a game over. A battery system is also present. The game is not finished in all the details; it lacks an ending cinematic and some graphical details.</p>

					<h2>Plateformer in python</h2>
					<p>During my first year of bachelor's degree, we had to participate in a 5-day hackathon in groups of 4. The goal was to create a platformer game using Pygame, a Python module dedicated to video game development. From these 5 days, the game "Pizza Vigilante" was born.</p>

					</div>
					<p>This project taught me about teamwork. Since the teams were randomly assigned, we had to work with everyone's ideas and skills. I learned how to design a small project from the initial specifications to its completion.

					<h2>Plateformer with Godot</h2>
					<p>During the holiday, I wanted to try a software more suitable for game development than Python. I did some research and decided to give Godot a try. I watched several hours of tutorials to create a small platformer game. The game is a speedrun with multiple timed levels, featuring a wall jump system and door opening mechanics. The best times are saved on the player's PC, allowing them to try and beat their own high score.</p>

					<p>This project has taught me the basics of Godot and has inspired me to delve even further into game development software. I plan to hone my skills in Godot and learn new software as well. If you'd like to try the game, you can <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sfJAhtZ6NK_tIL-lfhC5v_AfOZ0UzV4E/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">click here.</a></p>
